  PDBName: 1BNA
  PDBinformation:
  - The 1BNA structure represents the B-form of double-stranded DNA, often referred
    to as canonical B-DNA.
  - This is the most common form of DNA found in cells under physciological conditions,
    and it serves as the textbook example of DNA's iconic double helix shape.
  - 1BNA is not a protein, but a short segment of synthetic DNA.
  - The B-form DNA is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between base pairs and base
    stacking interactions.
  - A sugar-phosphate backbone stablizes the outer framework, while hydrogen bonds
    between bases hold the strands together.
  - 'Key Structural Features: - Right-handed B-DNA double helix, with about 10.5
    base pairs per helical turn, and a slight bend in the helix axis.'
  - '- Has major and minor grooves that allow proteins and enzymes to interact with
    specific DNA sequences (this is how the two ends of the helix overlap and interlock)'
