  PDBinformation:
  - 8H1B represents the high-resolution crystal structure of the MnmM methyltransferase
    from Staphylococcus aureus
  - This structure captures the enzyme complexed with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
    and a tRNA anticodon stem-loop (ASL), providing insights into its role in tRNA
    modification.
  - MnmM is a methyltransferase, which means it adds a small chemical group (a methyl
    group) to molecules.
  - Specifically, it modifies a part of tRNA, which is a molecule that helps translate
    genetic instructions (from mRNA) into proteins.
  - The modification occurs at a special spot in the tRNA called the wobble position,
    which affects how accurately the tRNA can pair with mRNA during protein synthesis.
