  PDBinformation:
  - 1MH1 structure is a complex of DNA plymerase 1 (POL 1) with a DNA fragment.
  - The active site of 1MH1 is more open and flexible compared to other polymerases.
    This allows it to fit unusual or damaged DNA templates -
  - like bent or broken rgeions that other polymerases cannot hanndle (adapts  its
    shape to DNA).
  - Beta Sheets contribute the most to the proteins core stability.
  - These flat, sheet-like arrangements of amino acids from hydrogen bonds between
    strands,
  - ' creating a rigid scaffold that supports the overall fold of the protein.'
  - Alpha helices provide flexibility and binding pockets to enable function.
